        <p4>About Me</p4>
    </div id="Me">
    <p1 style="color:white">My name is Michael Peters. I was born and raised in Southern California. 
          I was raised alongside my triplet siblings, me included, and my older brother.
        What got me into the major of Computer Information Technology was the fact that 
        Since I was kid, i was told that going into the medical field would gurantee success.
        However, it wasn't my main interest. It was technology that would captrue my attention.
        Whether it was gaming or helping my family with their devices by troubleshooting and finding
        the issue, it was always my niche.

        <p1 style="color:white"> I am now attending the California State University of Northridge and am pursuing a
        degree in Computer Information Technology and a minor in Geographic Information Science.
        In the future with my degree, I hope to become a Data Scientist. Another occupation that 
        I am also highly interested in becoming is a Cyber Security Analyst.

        <p4>My projects</p4>
        </div>
        <p1 style="color:white"> I have created projects such as a Binary Tree and 
            and Information System Projects that involve utilizing Access and Excel
            to analyze statistical data. The list of my work on GitHub. However, especially
            still being at an entry level, I haven't created very many projects since the 
            Computer IT major does not focus on creating programs, rather you are handling 
            pre-built systems and operating systems overall. But I do hope to create more,
            especially with this opportunity of the summer!
